# Vulkan Tutorial
This repo is to store my own version of the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) in full modern C++ (as much as possible) with the hpp vulkan header !

## Configuration used
OS : Linux. Because it is easier.

Lib : [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) (of course) used in version before 1.0.x and for mathematics computation : [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/).
