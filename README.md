# Vulkan Tutorial

So this is the Readme !

This repo is to store my own version of the Vulkan Tutorial in full modern C++ with the hpp vulkan header !

## Current config
I have the GLFW library at the root of the project (not included in the git, you can download it yourself).
You have to have vulkan and its SDK installed of course.
